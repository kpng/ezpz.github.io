**Attention**: Please use the [AWS Amplify](https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify) library for React Native development of new projects on AWS.

We've also released a React Native starter kit at https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-react-native-starter. This kit demonstrates a working React Native app with the following services:

* Amazon Cognito User Pools
* Amazon Cognito Federated Identities
* Amazon API Gateway
* AWS Lambda
* Amazon DynamoDB
* Amazon S3
* AWS Mobile Hub

This developer preview is currently under review and we will be looking to merge the contents in the future under a single repository for all AWS React Native functionality. In the meantime, we recommend you leverage the [AWS Amplify](https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify) library or the [AWS JavaScript SDK with React Native support](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js).

# AWS SDK for React Native

Weâ€™re excited to offer a developer preview of the AWS SDK for React Native. The SDK includes support for the following services:

1. [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store user data, including photos and videos, in the cloud. It uses the TransferUtility, which simplifies file transfers between your app and the cloud.
2. [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) to store data into a NoSQL database.
3. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) to run serverless code in the cloud without the need for backend infrastructure.
4. [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) to send and receive push notifications.

The SDK core uses [Amazon Cognito Identity](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) as the authentication provider to comply with best practices for mobile app development.
